behind the power of this script not being just AI Generated but "Triston" and human powered!
I show and explain my work to get the answer in real time, HERE in this video below!


I am not a prompt engineer. I am a Functional Architect who uses AI as a tool, not a crutch.

The Challenge: I invite any Lead Engineer or Senior Developer to audit the TonDigitalStream MP4. Don't just look at the code—listen to the audio. Hear me catch the logic gaps in C that the AI missed.








## Hi there 👋Technical Skill Spotlight: Spatial Logic & Coordinate Systems

I safely access update, advance, work with, and improve scripts

producing the necessary results of your choice. 

using my skill showcased and displayed in my TonDigitalStream repostitory with -----real time recorded Mp4  with original audio----- to 

vocalise my expert presence and strong capabilities with new langauge and problems i am freshly exposed to  by

Upoading a video example where I deal with an operation that I decided to carry out by    -    accessing a AI Assisted generated script 

code and changing it to suit my needs to show that it my strong suit. Using my understanding of the code that is already there to produce

the results I want.










that are already written and need a high class engineer to manage. I understand them and access them for you on a native level 

I leverage trigonometric functions ($\sin, \cos$) and geometric constants ($\pi$) to manage multi-axis data flows.

My approach focuses on 'Practical Resiliency'—the ability to maintain procedural integrity and system uptime while navigating complex, high-velocity coordinate environments."
