## Hi there 👋Technical Skill Spotlight: Spatial Logic & Coordinate Systems

"Specialized in non-linear terminal manipulation and real-time logic repair. 

I leverage trigonometric functions ($\sin, \cos$) and geometric constants ($\pi$) to manage multi-axis data flows.

My approach focuses on 'Practical Resiliency'—the ability to maintain procedural integrity and system uptime while navigating complex, high-velocity coordinate environments."
